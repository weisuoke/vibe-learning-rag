# Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems

In this section we provide a comprehensive overview of evaluating Agentic AI Systems, including evaluation layers, dimensions, methods, and frameworks.

For an overview of evaluating Gen-AI Systems (which are not agentic), see details in [Gen-AI Systems Evaluation](./gen-ai-evals.md). But below is a summary of the key points:

### **Evaluating Gen-AI Systems (key points)**

1. **Model Evals**:
    - Focus on criteria, core metrics, and evaluation methods (objective, subjective, AI/human judges, ranking) for model(s).
    - Evaluate models for *performance (accuracy, quality, etc.), latency, and cost*.
2. **System Evals**:
    - Design pipelines to evaluate all components, set clear guidelines, select appropriate methods/datasets, and monitor with scoring, rubrics, and feedback loops.
    - Evaluate systems for task and system-level *performance, cost, resource usage, latency, and reliability*.

**Best Practices:**
- Use a mix of automated metrics, LLM judging, and human feedback.
- Assess both *Model* and *End-2-End system* in real-world use.
- Evaluate all components of the system, not just the model.

### Evaluating Agentic AI Systems

- Agentic AI Systems add extra layers of complexity to the evaluation process by introducing agents, tools, memory, and orchestration layers.
